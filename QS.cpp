/*
 * medianOfThree()
 *
 * The median of three pivot selection has two parts:
 *
 * 1) Calculates the middle index by averaging the given left and right indices:
 *
 * middle = (left + right)/2
 *
 * 2) Then bubble-sorts the values at the left, middle, and right indices.
 *
 * After this method is called, data[left] <= data[middle] <= data[right].
 * The middle index will be returned.
 *
 * Returns -1 if the array is empty, if either of the given integers
 * is out of bounds, or if the left index is not less than the right
 * index.
 *
 * @param left
 *         the left boundary for the subarray from which to find a pivot
 * @param right
 *         the right boundary for the subarray from which to find a pivot
 * @return
 *        the index of the pivot (middle index); -1 if provided with invalid input

 * Partitions a subarray around a pivot value selected according to
 * median-of-three pivot selection.  Because there are multiple ways to partition a list,
 * we will follow the algorithm on page 611 of the course text when testing this function.
 *
 * The values which are smaller than the pivot should be placed to the left
 * of the pivot; the values which are larger than the pivot should be placed
 * to the right of the pivot.
 *
 * Returns -1 if the array is null, if either of the given integers is out of
 * bounds, or if the first integer is not less than the second integer, or if the
 * pivot is not within the sub-array designated by left and right.
 *
 * @param left
 *         the left boundary for the subarray to partition
 * @param right
 *         the right boundary for the subarray to partition
 * @param pivotIndex
 *         the index of the pivot in the subarray
 * @return
 *        the pivot's ending index after the partition completes; -1 if
 *         provided with bad input
